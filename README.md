This is repository for website running on RPI 4 1GB.

This site is supposed to display graph of values from temp sensor and then it analyse arrived data. 
The data transmission was firstly made by MQTT broker, but now it is running on SQL database which is running in Homeassistant. 
I use SQL queries for getting the data out of database.
